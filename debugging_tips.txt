Some tips to debug the program with MAME

**** Modifying ROM locations

Copying from https://6502disassembly.com/mame-dbg.html:

"When disassembling code it's sometimes useful to modify the code to
see what effect it has. For example, if a chunk of code is doing
something with a sound effect but you're not sure what, you can tweak or
disable it and then observe the change.

If you try to do this from the memory window you'll find that it doesn't work.
The trick is to change the "Region" pop-up in the Memory View window from
the default to "Region ':maincpu'".

Once you've done this, you can edit ROM values directly."

**** You can specify conditions in the breakpoints.
For example:
wpset 0,65535,rw,ix==e395


The lives (+1) are stored at 0xE084.
Let's look look between 0 and 65535, read-write with a condition:
wpset 0,65535,rw,ix==e395

**** The cheatinit command is useful to find variables.

cheatinit [<sign><width><swap>,[<address>,<length>[,<cpu>]]]
cheatinit ub, 0, 0xffff

cheatnext equal
cheatnext increase
cheatnext decrease

**** Clearing breakpoints and watchpoints

bpclear
wpclear

**** You can add conditions and execute code in the breakpoints and watchpoints:

From https://docs.mamedev.org/debugger/breakpoint.html:

bp 23456,a0 == 0 && a1 == 0
    Set a breakpoint for the visible CPU that will halt execution whenever the PC is equal to 23456 and the expression a0 == 0 && a1 == 0 is true.

bp 3456:audiocpu,1,{ printf "A0=%08X\n",a0 ; g }
    Set a breakpoint for the CPU with the absolute tag path :audiocpu that will halt execution whenever the PC is equal to 3456. When this happens, print A0=<a0val> to the debugger console and resume execution.

bp 45678:2,a0==100,{ a0 = ff ; g }
    Set a breakpoint on the third CPU in the system (zero-based index) that will halt execution whenever the PC is equal to 45678 and the expression a0 == 100 is true. When that happens, set a0 to ff and resume execution.

temp0 = 0 ; bp 567890,++temp0 >= 10
    Set a breakpoint for the visible CPU that will halt execution whenever the PC is equal to 567890 and the expression ++temp0 >= 10 is true. This effectively breaks only after the breakpoint has been hit sixteen times.

****
Use the bit(...) function to extract bits and use them in BP or WP conditions.
This is particularly useful when the variable is a bitmask.

From https://docs.mamedev.org/debugger/:
    bit(<x>, <n>[, <w>])

    Extracts and right-aligns a bit field <w> bits wide from <x> with least significant bit position position <n>, counting from the least significant bit. If <w> is omitted, a single bit is extracted.

**** Modifying MAME to help debugging.

Compile with
$ make SUBTARGET=arcade -j8 && ./mamearcade -debug -rompath ~/juegos/mame kungfum

The files of interest are those related to Z80:
    src/devices/cpu/z80/z80.h
    src/devices/cpu/z80/z80.cpp

You can force a break from the C++ code with:
    machine().debug_break();

You can print from the OSD with:
    osd_printf_warning("%04X, %04X\n", PC, IX);

** Debugging table accesses:

It's very useful to print messages when accesing tables of the
form IX + off or IY + off. The effective addresses are computed with the
eax() and eay() functions. We can modify them to add our debugging code:

inline void z80_device::eax()
{
    uint8_t game_state = rm(0xE000);    

    int8_t off = (int8_t)arg();
	m_ea = (uint32_t)(uint16_t)(IX + off);
    
    if (game_state == 4 && IX == TBL) {
        if (miguel_addresses.find(PC) == miguel_addresses.end()) {            
                printf("Accessing IX + %d = %04X from PC=%04X\n", (int8_t)off, (uint32_t)m_ea, PC);

        miguel_addresses.insert(PC);
        }
    }
	WZ = m_ea;
}

** Debugging bit masks:

I define a temp variable in the public part of "class z80_device : public cpu_device, public z80_daisy_chain_interface":
    uint8_t miguel_tmp_byte = 0;

And I use this code in z80.cpp to track individual bit changes:

uint8_t z80_device::rm(uint16_t addr)
{
	uint8_t res = m_data.read_byte(addr);
    
    uint16_t addr_interest = 0xE906; // PLAYER_STATE
    uint8_t bit_position = 0;
    
    if (addr == addr_interest) {
        uint8_t mask = 1 << bit_position;
        if ((res & mask) != (miguel_tmp_byte & mask)) {
            printf("Bit #%d flipped (now %d), addr=%04X\n", bit_position, (res & mask) >> bit_position, addr);
            miguel_tmp_byte = res;
            //machine().debug_break();
        }
    }    
	return res;
}
